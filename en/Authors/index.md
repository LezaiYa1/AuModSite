# Mod developers
Reflecting on the events surrounding Among Us in recent years, countless mods have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, all thanks to the hard work of developers.<br>
But, how many people truly remember their contributions?<br>
Much like the cessation of updates for [TownOfHostEdited](https://aumod.site/en/Mods/HostOnly/TownOfHostEdited), most players simply take endlessly, never offering even a word of thanks in return.<br>
They constantly demand developers to bring their outlandish ideas to life, without ever considering the feasibility of these ideas or whether the developers have the energy to realize them.<br>
Remember they, players.
