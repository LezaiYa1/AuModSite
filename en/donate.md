# Sponsorship
**Sponsor us! By getting sponsored, we can provide you with better services.**
## Why should you sponsor us?
"Among Us Mod Archive" is a website that records all Among Us mods that are open-sourced on GitHub.<br>
The initial purpose of creating this website is to provide completely free content (*after all, the website can't do anything special for paid content*), and to open-source it on GitHub.<br>
However, in order to provide high-quality content, we have invested a lot of money.<br>
From **server purchase**, **domain registration**, to **CDN services**, all of these require a lot of money.<br>
We are just a group of passionate students with limited funds, and we cannot afford these expenses.<br>
We hope you can lend a hand, even a sponsorship of less than 5 yuan can provide us with great help.
